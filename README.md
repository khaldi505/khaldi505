### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Full-stack Software Engineer specialized in Front-end development. I graduated from Holberton School in January 2022. I contributed with other peers from Holberton School on a variety of projects such as Airbnb clone and a constructive and inclusive social network that links artists to each other called [Blossom](https://github.com/Blossoom/blossoom-frontend). I prefer to work with JavaScript, TypeScript, reactJS, also confident with python and SQL. I am currently working on my portfolio, and searching for a full time position where I could add value to the team and grow as developer.
